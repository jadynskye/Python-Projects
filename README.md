# 🐍 Python Projects

While learning Python, I thought it would be important to track the small projects I work on as I strengthen my skills to see my progress as a Python developer! I aimed to stay away from chatgpt entirely as then I would not learn much or adapt my own coding style, instead I got all of my knowledge from FAU, w3schools, and teaching myself. This folder has a bunch of Python projects I’ve worked on to practice coding and learn how to build different programs. Each file shows something new I’ve tried, like games, apps, or using different Python features.

## 📁 Project List

- `hangman_game.py` – A word guessing game where the player tries to guess letters before the stick figure is fully drawn.
- `Password Generator Project.py` – Random password generator using letters, numbers, and symbols.
- `Online-Pizza-System.py` – Simple pizza ordering system that lets users choose pizzas and calculates the total.
- `Bill-Calculator.py` – Splits the bill between people and adds tip, based on user input.
- `Cafe_OOP_Principals.py` – A project that uses object-oriented programming (OOP) to model a cafe menu and customer types.
- `WordCoder.py` – Encodes and decodes words using a basic logic (like secret message builder).
- `RPS.py` – Classic rock, paper, scissors game against the computer.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

- Writing functions and using loops and conditionals
- Using input and output to make interactive programs
- Creating small games and simple systems
- Working with random numbers and string operations
- Using object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python

## 💻 How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
python filename.py

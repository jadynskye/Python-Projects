# Python-Projects
While teaching myself Python, I thought it would be important to track the small projects I work on as I strengthen my skills to see my progress as a Python developer! I aimed to stay away from chatgpt entirely as then I would not learn anything, instead I got all of my knowledge from w3schools and teaching myself.

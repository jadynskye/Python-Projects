# Python-Projects
While learning Python, I thought it would be important to track the small projects I work on as I strengthen my skills to see my progress as a Python developer! I aimed to stay away from chatgpt entirely as then I would not learn much or adapt my own coding style, instead I got all of my knowledge from FAU, w3schools, and teaching myself.

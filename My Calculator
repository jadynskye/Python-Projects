# Calculator program
# By : Jadyn Reid
# This program is a basic calculator that uses functions and a dictionary to perform math operations.
# It lets the user choose between addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
# Each operation is written as its own function and stored in a dictionary using the operator symbol as the key.
# The program keeps asking the user if they want to continue using the result or start over with a new number.

# Addition funcion 

def addition(num1, num2):
    """ 
    This funciton is to take the two
    users inputs, add them, and return 
    the output
    """
    output = num1 + num2
    return f"\n{num1} + {num2} = {output}"


# Subtraction funcion 

def subtraction(num1, num2):
    """ 
    This funciton is to take the two
    users inputs, subtract them, and return 
    the output
    """
    output = num1 - num2 
    return f"\n{num1} - {num2} = {output}"


# Multiplication function 

def multiplication(num1, num2):
    """ 
    This funciton is to take the two
    users inputs, multiply them, and return 
    the output
    """
    output = num1 * num2 
    return f"\n{num1} * {num2} = {output}"

# Division function 

def division(num1, num2):
    """ 
    This funciton is to take the two
    users inputs, divides them, and return 
    the output
    """
    output = num1 / num2 
    return f"\n{num1} / {num2} = {output}"
